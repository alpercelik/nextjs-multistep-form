This is a demonstration project showcasing a multi-step form built with [Next.js](https://nextjs.org), styled using [TailwindCSS](https://tailwindcss.com) and [shadcn](https://ui.shadcn.dev/), and validated using [react-hook-form](https://react-hook-form.com) and [zod](https://zod.dev/). It includes file upload functionality powered by [react-dropzone](https://react-dropzone.js.org).

## Project Setup and Usage

To set up and start the development server:

```bash
npm run dev
# or
yarn dev
# or
pnpm dev
# or
bun dev
```

Open [http://localhost:3000](http://localhost:3000) with your browser to see the result.

The entry point of the application is `app/page.tsx`. This file can be edited to customize the multi-step form. Changes are reflected automatically during development.

The project utilizes [`next/font`](https://nextjs.org/docs/app/building-your-application/optimizing/fonts) for optimized font loading and offers a consistent and responsive design with TailwindCSS and shadcn components.
